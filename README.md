# E-Commerce Test App

**Test App Implemented by Eng, Ali Fouanne for I.O Tech Company**

App Link: [E-Commerce Test App](https://ecommerce-ali.vercel.app)

I built this app using React.JS and used Vite as a build tool. For global state management, I used Zustand. The styling is done with Tailwind CSS. Authentication is handled through Firebase Email Auth. To fetch data from APIs, I used React Query, and for routing, I implemented React Router Dom.

## Guide

1. **Sign Up**: Start by signing up using your email and password. If you already have an account, you can sign in. Remember, you can't access other routes without signing up.

2. **Home (Products)**: After logging in, you'll be directed to a page containing all the products fetched from a dummy API. Clicking on the Amazon logo takes you back to the home (products) page. Click "Log Out" to return to the sign-in page.

3. **Checkout**: The Checkout page displays all the products you've selected. You can remove or add products to your basket. The page also shows the total price of the products. In the future, we may add a payment method for this project.

## Navigation Bar

The navigation bar features four buttons for filtering and sorting products on the main page. Each product includes an "Add to Basket" button for easy selection.

Feel free to explore and enjoy using the E-Commerce Test App!
